# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I feel very confident in my understanding of the comparison operators. The more I get to use them in real examples the more confident I feel. 

2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- I feel like the logical operators are pretty straight forward at this point. I felt comfortable using them in this assignment. 

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- I've practiced the if, else if, and else statements before starting Turing so they feel not too challenging at this point. I used to get mixed up with some of the syntax but with more examples to work on, I feel like its been getting easier! 

4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I spent a little less than 1.5 hours to finish this lesson. I estimated 1.5 hours so I was right in the ball park range. 

5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I still need to practice problem solving. Right now the scenarios are given to us. My concern at this moment is, "How will I respond when I'm given a general problem without any kind of framework?" I'm thinking these type of scenarios will come up soon and I just need to be patient and trust the process. In order to get more practice, I can come up with example scenarios and develop them in my free time. I also need to remember to capitalize my commit statements. I found that I forget to do this sometimes. 

6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I felt like this assignment was pretty straight forward and I don't have any lingering questions. I know they will come up soon! Right now, Slacking my small group for questions is where I will go!
